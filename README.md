# Odin Project Admin Dashboard

This project is a practice project that was built in accordance with the ODIN Project Admin Dashboard assignment to practice creating a front-end design utilizing CSS Grid.

I was provided with a design-file to develop however, as this file was provided as a png file, I did my best to match the visual layout of this design but the exact layout may vary slightly.
